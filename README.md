<!-- How I worked -->
<h2 id="how-I-worked">How I worked? </h2>
<ul>
  <li>My goal of the project was to work on a React App which would be based on updation of UI components as per the state changes in different scenarios. So, I developed this app to brush my skills by implementing those stuffs.</li>
  <li>I have used Agile methodology to complete the whole application. I developed each segment and features of the app in small increments by implementing one thing and once and making sure it works perfectly.</li>
  <li>The design inspiration was taken from takenotes.dev.</li>
</ul>

<!-- How I developed -->
<h2 id="how-I-develop">How I built this project? </h2>
<ul>
  <li>I have used React.js frontend library for development of this app.</li>
  <li>React Bootstrap Framework along with some custom CSS has been used for designing the UI of the app.</li>
  <li>I have used just <code>useState</code> hook and <code>Redux State Management</code> to handle all sort of state management.</li>
  <li>Search features has been implemented using the JavaScript filter method.</li>
</ul>
